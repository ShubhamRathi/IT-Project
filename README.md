IT-Project: Synesthesia+Peer-Peer Video Calling
==========

 The project intends to take responsive web design beyond the periphery of screen and browser portability/ Dimension. The theme of the project is to have dynamic websites which react to Live Audio Stream as event handlers. This helps to reduce the cognitive load on the user who can now access the screen control by gestures like whistle. While the core concept revolves around audio interactivity in websites, we also intend to develop a pseudo online skype type application that allows video calling without any registration hassle.
